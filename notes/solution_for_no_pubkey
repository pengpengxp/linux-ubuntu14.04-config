I've added these two lines:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/fcitx-team/nightly/ubuntu quantal main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/fcitx-team/nightly/ubuntu quantal main
to the file of /etc/apt/sources.list and execute the command of
sudo apt-get update
in the terminal, then an error occurs:
W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 6ADC9FEC7E5FA1EE

To solve the problem, do the following step:
execute this command:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6ADC9FEC7E5FA1EE
in the terminal, then update sources again.

Yeah, no error occurs! Have fun!
