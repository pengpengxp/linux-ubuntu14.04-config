My name is XiePeng,and I was born in LeShan,SiChuan province.
In my hometown,Leshan Buddha and mount E'mei are very famous all around the world.
I am a postgraduate student ,studying in ChongQing university of posts and telecommulication.
I get my bachelor's degree in Xi'an university of technology.
When I was a undergraduate student,my major is printing engineering.
But now,I study computer science in chongqing.
//I have many interests,such as swimming,listening to some music,running,hiking ,playing basketball,and so on.
I like sports very much,it make me very healthy and optimistic.
But chongqing is so fogy and wet and it's so hard to get some sunshigh.
Sometimes it makes running,hiking impossible,so I don't like the weahter here very much.
Now,i want to pass this examination and get my Bussiness Engnish Certification.
Because next summer holiday,i want to find a company,like tencent,to work in.
If I get my Certification,it can be a prove of my english ability.
It can help me to get more opportunities.
