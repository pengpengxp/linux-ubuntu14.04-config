Moving focus and buffer between Emacs window

For the basics, check the excellent article Moving between Emacs windows.

If you are impatient to read the above article, here is my summary:

    you can use windmove.el (embedded in Emacs). Its hotkey are Shift+Arrow.
    switch-window.el is great. The default hot key is “C-x o”.

I love switch-windows.el. It’s only three key strikes to select a window.

I also use other packages which requrie less key strikes than switch-windows.el.
1 window-numbering.el

window-numbering.el is the my most favourite package. It uses hot key “M-NUM” to switch window (for example, “M-3″ to select window with number 3). By using this package I can press only one key to switch window. Besides, it has some extra features like hotkey “M-0″ to jump to the minbuffer.

Here is my configuration of window-numbering.el:
(require 'window-numbering)
;; highlight the window number in pink color
(custom-set-faces '(window-numbering-face ((t (:foreground "DeepPink" :underline "DeepPink" :weight bold)))))
(window-numbering-mode 1)

2 evil-mode

evil-mode is a vim-emulation. It use vim’s hot keys (C-w h/j/k/l) to move. If you set the CAPSLOCK key to ctrl key, you will notice “C-w h” is more efficient than “C-x o”. It’s because “w” key is more close than “x” key and you don’t need move finger when pressing “h/j/k/l”.

3 buffer-move.el

buffer-move.el moves the buffer instead of focus between windows. It can be installed through MELPA.

Here is my configuration:
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b C-k")     'buf-move-up)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b C-j")   'buf-move-down)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b C-h")   'buf-move-left)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b C-l")  'buf-move-right)

4 updated

I use keyfreq to record all my key pressing for more than six months.

According to the data collected by keyfreq, more than 99 percent of my moving focus between windows is done through window-numbering.el.

So it’s necessary to optimize window-numbering.el further. By default, window-numbering.el uses “M-num” key to select window which is already efficient. But as a geek, I have a tendency to push the efficiency to the extreme end.

Finally I use hotkey “,1″, “,2″, and “,3″ to switch to the window numbering “1″, “2″, and “3″ in evil-mode?

Here is the code:
(define-key evil-normal-state-map ",1" 'select-window-1)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map ",2" 'select-window-2)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map ",3" 'select-window-3)

This could be regarded as an example how I take advantage of evil and evil-leader.

Check my code at github to see complete configuration.

Emacs中的完美多窗口操作
典型的工作流

    在两个子窗口中对比文件内容
    打开更多的窗口以参考其他信息.
    对某个窗口内容比较有兴趣,跳转到该窗口,将该窗口最大化
    看完最大化的窗口内容后,undo最大化操作,重新回到早先的多个小窗口模式以便继续纵览全局

将子窗口自动编号,然后按M-0…9跳转(最爱)

安装window-numbering.el,然后在.emacs中添加以下代码,

(require 'window-numbering)
(window-numbering-mode 1)

undo/redo之前的窗口操作(最爱)

安装Winner Mode,然后在.emacs中添加以下代码,

(winner-mode 1)
;; copied from http://puntoblogspot.blogspot.com/2011/05/undo-layouts-in-emacs.html
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 4 u") 'winner-undo)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 4 r") 'winner-redo)

焦点移动到下一窗口(常用)

M-x other-window,快捷键是`C-x o`.
水平/垂直切分当前窗口(常用)

快捷键C-x 2/3
将当前子窗口最大化(常用)

M-x delete-other-windows,快捷键`C-x 1`.
删除当前子窗口(偶尔用)

M-x delete-window (快捷键`C-x 0`)

顺便说一下,M-x kill-buffer-and-window (快捷键`C-x 4 0`),我现在用得更多 些.
移动焦点到上下左右的窗口(基本不用)

因我较喜欢vi快捷键,所以我安装了Evil Mode.快捷键和Vi一样. C-w h/j/k/l移动至各方向的子窗口.
存储/载入窗口布局到register(基本不用)

`C-x r w <register>`存储,`C-x r j <register>`载入.
